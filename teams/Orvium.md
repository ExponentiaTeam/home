# The Orvium Project

Researchers have to publish papers to share their findings, making scientific publishing really important for their careers and for scientific progress.
One of the major problems is that running scientific journals is very difficult and costly to maintain.
Orvium makes it very simple to create and manage open access journals. The goal is that every university, research lab, or group of researchers, can create high quality journals with just a few clicks.


## The Technology

- Microservices that are very flexible and is helpful to adapt and evolve fast
- Blockchain is the only technology that can ensure independent transparency and security to:
	- Decentralize the publishing process
	- Gamifying scientific publishing, we have to incentivize academics to contribute and collaborate and give reputation to the community members 
	- Track the activity of scientific publishing, making it traceable and transparent for everyone.
- Angular provides a powerful web browser technology
- NestJS backend API


## The Repos

Write here:  
 - The link to each repo
 - What each repo does 
 - The requirement of each repo
 - How the repos interact with each other

Examples: 

###  Repo-Backend
 - [Repo-Backend](https://github.com/deCODEproject/zenroom)
 - ***Repo-Backend*** does basic cryptography and contains most of the business logic
 - It requires Node-JS 14 or above
 - It connects to Repo-MongoDB and with Repo-FrontEnd
