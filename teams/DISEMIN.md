# The Distributed Secure Smart Farming Log (DISEMIN) Project

Ex Machina is an IoT system integrator that serves industrial customers with environmental monitoring & predictive analytics solutions, using machine learning and modular hardware.
Like most Greeks, we have farmers in our family and we see that the farming digital transformation promise is derailing.  We see farmers losing control over their farming practices, becoming alienated from their work and having to adjust to technology and large corporations rather than the other way round.
We decided to enter the agricultural space, with our open IoT solutions and the goal to create a marketplace where farmers and advisors can share data and services in a fair manner.


## The Technology

We will provide a complete opensource IoT solution that combines a farmerâ€™s log mobile application with crop sensor data using a distributed ledger built in to the hardware, and a marketplace that will enable farmers and advisors to collaborate.

 - [Repo-Backend](https://github.com/deCODEproject/zenroom)
 - ***Repo-Backend*** does basic cryptography and contains most of the business logic
 - It requires Node-JS 14 or above
 - It connects to Repo-MongoDB and with Repo-FrontEnd
