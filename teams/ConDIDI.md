# The ConDIDI Project

ConDIDI will develop the full lifecycle for digital conference credentials. Our first application is to allow conference participants to easily demonstrate their level of involvement at scientific conferences using the technology of self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials. However this technology is not restricted to conferences only, instead it can be used for any kind of credentials.


## The Technology

We will build on the SSI framework already developed by Jolocom. We have not yet made a decision regarding the conference credential front end, and we will first look into the requirements of the users to decide what is a good technology solution. Conference organisers will have to work with digital signatures, so we need to create an easy to use and integrate workflow.rs will have to work with digital signatures, so we need to create an easy to use and integrate workflow.d to create an easy to use and integrate workflow. we will first look into the requirements of the users to decide what is a good technology solution.

## The Repos

Write here:  
 - The link to each repo
 - What each repo does 
 - The requirement of each repo
 - How the repos interact with each other

Examples: 

###  Repo-Backend
 - [Repo-Backend](https://github.com/deCODEproject/zenroom)
 - ***Repo-Backend*** does basic cryptography and contains most of the business logic
 - It requires Node-JS 14 or above
 - It connects to Repo-MongoDB and with Repo-FrontEnd
 

## Misc

This stuff  **is in bold** and this is ***in italic*** 

## Links


This how to link, it works both internal: [Basic info](/general/basic.md "The Basic info") and external: [Zenroom home](https://zenroom.org/) and this is simple external link  <https://zenroom.org/>, plain html works too.
