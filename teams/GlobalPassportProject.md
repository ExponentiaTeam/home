# The Global Passport Project

In 2015 the terrible news of a 14-year-old Malian boy drowned in a shipwreck in the Mediterranean with his school reports in his pocket marked a change in the perception of migrants attempting to reach Europe. Global Passport Project is a breakthrough initiative that leverages on decentralized technology to support refugees and mixed migrants along their journey, protect their privacy while reporting human rights violations, and engage them as citizens integrating in their new communities. GPP will enormously improve the capacity of NGOs and social enterprises to reach out to migrants and design their actions, thus streamlining their resources and improving their performance and records when applying for funds and calls.

## The Technology

We plan to use the following technologies but we are evaluating alternative components with existing decentralized technologies and are open for discussion:

 - Ionic Angular (mobile and website)
 - Node.js, PostgrSQL (back-end)
 - Ethereum, IPFS, web3.js (blockchain)
 - GNU LGPL 
	
## The Repos

Write here:  
 - The link to each repo
 - What each repo does 
 - The requirement of each repo
 - How the repos interact with each other

Examples: 

###  Repo-Backend
 - [Repo-Backend](https://github.com/deCODEproject/zenroom)
 - ***Repo-Backend*** does basic cryptography and contains most of the business logic
 - It requires Node-JS 14 or above
 - It connects to Repo-MongoDB and with Repo-FrontEnd
